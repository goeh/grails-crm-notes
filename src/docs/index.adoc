== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer relationship management
Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Notes Plugin

The +crm-notes+ plugin provide storage, services and Groovy Server Pages to support adding text notes to domain instances.
A *note* is a short message (max 2000 characters) with a subject. A note can be added to any domain instance.
Notes are automatically stamped with date/time and user that created the note.

Common use-cases for notes are logging stuff that happened in relation to a domain instance.
Application code can also add notes automatically when emails are sent or other important events happened.

=== Whats the difference between notes and tasks?

Some might argue that there is an overlap between notes and tasks. Tasks are provided by the +crm-task+ plugin
and also contains a subject and message. Tasks are more complex and can certainly be used for logging purposes
but notes are simple and easy to use. If both +crm-notes+ and +crm-task-ui+ plugins are used in the same application
users might also be confused over what to use. For example when a user called a contact and talked about something important.
Should that be logged as a simple note on the contact or as a completed tasks associated with the contact?
There is no simple answer, it depends on the requirements and something you have to discuss with your users.

=== Inject notes in GSPs

The plugin provides a GSP view that can be embedded in tabbed {gr8crm} pages.
To inject the note view in *Contact Details* page from the +crm-contact-ui+ plugin, add the following code to +BootStrap.groovy+.

[source,groovy]
.BootStrap.groovy
----
class BootStrap {

    def crmCoreService
    def crmPluginService
    def crmNotesService

    def init = { servletContext ->
        crmPluginService.registerView('crmContact', 'show', 'tabs',   // <1>
            [id: "notes",
                index: 600, // <2>
                permission: "crmNotes:show", // <3>
                label: "crmContact.tab.notes.label",
                template: '/crmNotes/embedded', plugin: "crm-notes",
                model: {
                    def id = crmCoreService.getReferenceIdentifier(crmContact)    // <4>
                    def result = crmNotesService.findNotesByReference(crmContact) // <5>
                    return [bean: crmContact, list: result, totalCount: result.size(), reference: id]
                } // <6>
            ]
        )
    }
}
----
<1> Add the tab to crmContact/show.gsp
<2> Tab order, lower number tabs are inserted to the left of higher number tabs.
<3> Permission *crmNotes:show* is required to see the note tab
<4> The reference identifier is used to create a *dynamic relation* between the note and the domain instance.
<5> Find existing notes attached to the domain instance so the inserted view/tab can list them.
<6> The +model+ Closure have access to page scope in crmContact/show.gsp and can therefore reference the domain instance *crmContact*.

The note view will display a list of notes attached to a domain instance and includes a button to add notes.

The views uses Twitter Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for interaction.

== CrmNotesService

You can use +CrmNotesService+ to create notes programatically.

=== Create a note

+CrmNote create(Object reference, String subject, String text, String author = null, boolean save = false)+

This method creates a new +CrmNote+ instance and attach it to a domain instance +reference+.
If +author+ is null the current authenticated user will be assigned as the author or the note.

=== Retrieve a note

+CrmNote getNote(Long id)+

Get a note based on primary key.

=== List notes

+List findNotesByReference(reference, params = [:])+

List all notes attached to a domain instance +reference+. Sorting and pagination parameters can be specified with +params+.

=== Delete a note

+boolean deleteNote(CrmNote note)+

Deleted a note instance.

+int deleteAllNotes(reference)+

Deletes all notes attached to a domain instance +reference+. Returns the number of notes deleted.

== Configuration

=== Edit window

A note is normally immutable which means that is cannot be edited.
Because notes are commonly used a log records you don't want users to be able to change the history.
But if notes are added manually the user could make spelling errors or other typos. It's nice to give the user an opportunity to correct their mistakes.
Therefore you can configure an *edit window* that makes it possible to edit the note during a short period after it was created.

[source,groovy]
.Config.groovy
----
crm.notes.editWindow = 2 // enables editing during two hours after the note was created.
